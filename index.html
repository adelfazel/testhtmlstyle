				<h2> Introduction here are my thoughts on why Clinton lost</h2>
					<p class="top_paragraph">
						In a globally interlinked world, global events can be attributed to many causes. Isolationting a 'cause' that can explain overly complex matters is stupid. We are humans and we talking about past events is what we do till we die. So why not give my narrative of a an event that was both impactful and many got wrong? That event happens to be 2016 US election. Ideas herein are not novel nor are mentioned in any particular order nor reflect reality. They are written as assignment for practicing css, nothing political!
					</p>
					<h2> Why does it matter </h2>
						<p class="mid_paragraph"> The odds of Trump winning was 1:100 according to some gambling websites. I expected that he is going to win but was hesitant tbo participate. In the restrospect, I would. What did I know that many didn't? Not sure. When I speak to Clinton supporters, and tell them that I dislike her dishonstey, some agree some accuse me of sexism. When I tell them I voted for a female here, they float. And they get angry over it. No wonder media they watch get things so 'wrong'. 
					   </p>
					<h2> Why am I voicing my opinion </h2>
   						<p class="bot_paragraph"> Assault to langauge by media and people who parrot what they heard. The insult to language is everywhere, major train stations in Australia are filled with news. It is more painful when 'people' who vote listen to that 'news' and believe it. Some actually believe in these stuff. And they vote and bring their ideas to my ear. <a href="ideas.html">List of ideas they use in voting and discussing</a>. People I meet daily seem to me and I to them aliens. We do not speak the same language and I am going to share with you what the say <a href="#">Here</a>. Aim  undrestand for others.
